***Note Taker App***

Beginning with the code provided in class, this code implements a simple note-taker app that allows
the user to enter new notes and to display the numbered notes. Blank note entry is disallowed.

*Key dfferences from teacher implementation*
- array list instead of map for data structure for notes
- all javascript code moved to separate .js file
